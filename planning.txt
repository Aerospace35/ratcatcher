NFC / QR URL needs to contain the following data
set ID to crossreference how many tests have been used, ident, etc
Quantity of tests originally (5)
Type of test (to determine if is valid) (0=Test,1=COVID,etc)
Security integer (basic cryptography to prevent low-level data poisoning)

(24378)(05)(01)(34)

243785134 would be the data encoded with a URL on the NFC or QR code. The program reads
right to left. Two digit security code, 1 digit test type, 2 digit test quantity, and the rest
is a "serial number" of sorts to deal with identification.

Each test cassette would be numbered, to make reporting easier. User interface will allow user to select test and report result.

User will be able to access their history, report data, and be directed to telehealth or local doctors if needed, as well as find
easy-to-access and understandable information regarding their eligibility for Paxlovid and vaccinations.

The admin side will allow tests to be examined individually, marked for review, or examined as a whole to see trends and groupings.
