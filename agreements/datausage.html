<b>For those uploading data:</b>
<br>
Data you upload to ratcatcher will be publicly accessible to some extent. <b>Your personal 
information including contact information and your name will not be displayed</b>, but your approximate location 
as provided by you in the "city" field when uploading information will be visible, as well 
as the time the test was taken, your gender and age, and your test result. These metrics are 
invaluable in tracing disease outbreaks. Your usage of ratcatcher implies consent to this usage. 
You may withdraw consent at any point by emailing brodie_friesen@yahoo.com and mentioning the email, 
phone number, or name that you used. To maintain user privacy, we may delete personal information in 
compliance with regulations.

<b>For those downloading data:</b>
<br>
We understand data is extremely important in a variety of ways, disease outbreak more than most types. 
However, user protection is our number one priority. As such, all data will be purged of identifying 
information. Elevated access including travel statistics may be granted at our discretion, and only after 
a thorough vetting and proposal process. Your usage of our data is a privilege, just as our usage of user data 
to offer this site is a privilege. Betraying the trust of those who upload sensitive information is disgusting 
and we reserve the right to restrict access to data if abuse is detected.
