# ratcatcher
A utility to track and categorize statistics related to Rapid Access Testing for COVID-19

# This repository was conceived for the Recess Hacks 3.0 hackathon

ratcatcher is an easy-to-deploy utility designed to take a variety of user input from a validated RAT test kit (via QR code or NFC) and then upload it to a database where researchers and government officials can view a map and searchable table displaying symptoms and case statistics.

ratcatcher is easily configurable and as such is not constrained to just working as a COVID-19 tracking system. The authentication can be switched off to allow self-reporting and outbreak tracking of any illness, and to support traditional RAT kits that do not have NFC or QR code-based identification and authentication.
